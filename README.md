# Description

The following projects contain wrapper functions around apple-gen for:
1) Generating validation data
2) Encryption of io platform variables / IOPower variables
3) Generating anisette data (TBD)

There is also a native python module to give access to the rust library through PYO3, which builds wheels for your desired python version with maturin.

apple-auth-utils requires [apple-gen](https://github.com/Smoothstep/apple-gen) to build correctly. 

# Status

This is only an early implementation, thus most code is subject to change.
For more information, refer to the apple-gen repository.
